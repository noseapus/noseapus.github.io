# About This Blog
I'm writing this page mostly to figure out how to write a website. I want to record the events of Doctor Who (only new series 1-10), but in Earth's chronology rather than the Doctor's. Before I  attempt that abitious project, I'm doing this.

As a future project, I would love to take the Big Bang Theory and edit out the laugh track. Since I have neither the skills nor the video, it must remain a hypothetical. If not for the laugh track, and some other unfortunate anachronisms, I would rate the Big Bang Theory very highly

Instead, here is a list of noteable events and time cuts for the Big Bang Theory I have chosen to record

# The Chronology
S2:E5: "The Euclid Alternative" 9:00. First time we see the desk-side wall of Sheldon's appartment
