## About This Blog
I'm writing this page mostly to figure out how to write a website. I want to record the events of Doctor Who (only new series 1-10), but in Earth's chronology rather than the Doctor's. Before I  attempt that abitious project, I'm doing this. This blog also serves as a generic, lightweight placeholder to use whilst I figure out other parts of my website.

As a future project, I would love to take the Big Bang Theory and edit out the laugh track. Since I have neither the skills nor the video, it must remain a hypothetical. If not for the laugh track, and some other unfortunate anachronisms, I would rate the Big Bang Theory very highly

Instead, here is a list of noteable events and time cuts for the Big Bang Theory I have chosen to record

## The Chronology
S3:E14 "The Einstein Approximation". In the last scene (17:46), we see a flashback to earier in the episode (9:06), in what appears to be an extended, alternate cut of the infamous Ballpit Bazinga Scene.

S3:E22 "The Staircase Implementation". This episode concerns Leonard moving in with Sheldon under the in-timeline guise of Leonard telling Penny about it. It also covers the first time he brought a girl over (Joyce Kim) and the events leading to the dysfunction of the elevator. Additionally we see Penny read a pregnancy test during her time in high school.

S5:E24 "The Countdown Reflection" is a series of flashbacks, interspersing Howard's Launch with the events leading up to that moment, with the couple trying to get married before the big event.

## Other notes

S2:E5 "The Euclid Alternative" 9:00. First time we see the desk-side wall of Sheldon's appartment.

S6:E15 "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation" at 7:22 we see for the first time Howard's mum.

### Soft Kitty

In S1:E11 "The Pancake Batter Anomaly", we are first introduced to "Soft Kitty" in D.

Subsequently however, an alternative version is sung, and in different keys, such as S3:E8 where it is sung in something approaching Db as a round, and at the end of S4:E2 as a round where Penny sings in C and Sheldon plays recorder in Db.

S5:E6 shows Sheldon's Mother singing Soft Kitty differently once again.

### Time travel
S3:E22, in the flashback to Sheldon and Leonard first signing the roommate aggreement, they agree to visit that moment in time should either of them invent time travel. However, in the opening of S1:E4 (later chronologically, but a previous episode), he ponders time travel, proclaiming that if he invents time travel, he would just give it back to himself. However, at this point, he would by his own logic, know he has not invented time travel.

### Howard's dad's letter
S6:E19 "The Closet Reconfiguration" revolves around a letter Howard recieved from his father on his 18th birthday. This storyline climaxes with the gang each giving an possible answer to what is in the card, with the pretense that only one of them is correct. Howard later says he wants all of them to be true and Leneord says that one of them is. However, what if all of them, besides Sheldon's red herring, are true? The accounts the gang give are each very short; I would not believe any of them are the full contents of the envelope. Taken together, they tell a full story of Howard's dad's regret.
