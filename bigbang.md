## About This Blog
I'm writing this page mostly to figure out how to write a website. I want to record the events of Doctor Who (only new series 1-10), but in Earth's chronology rather than the Doctor's. Before I  attempt that abitious project, I'm doing this. This blog also serves as a generic, lightweight placeholder to use whilst I figure out other parts of my website.

As a future project, I would love to take the Big Bang Theory and edit out the laugh track. Since I have neither the skills nor the video, it must remain a hypothetical. If not for the laugh track, and some other unfortunate anachronisms, I would rate the Big Bang Theory very highly

Instead, here is a list of noteable events and time cuts for the Big Bang Theory I have chosen to record

# The Chronology
S3:E14 "The Einstein Approximation". In the last scene (17:46), we see a flashback to earier in the episode (9:06), in what appears to be an extended, alternate cut of the infamous Ballpit Bazinga Scene.

S3:E22 "The Staircase Implementation". This episode concerns Leonard moving in with Sheldon under the in-timeline guise of Leonard telling Penny about it. It also covers the first time he brought a girl over (Joyce Kim) and the events leading to the dysfunction of the elevator. Additionally we see Penny read a pregnancy test during her time in high school.

# Other notes

S2:E5 "The Euclid Alternative" 9:00. First time we see the desk-side wall of Sheldon's appartment.

## Soft Kitty

In S1:E11 "The Pancake Batter Anomaly", we are first introduced to "Soft Kitty" in D.

Subsequently however, an alternative version is sung, and in different keys, such as S3:E8 where it is sung in something approaching Db as a round, and at the end of S4:E2 as a round where Penny sings in C and Sheldon plays recorder in Db.

## Time travel
S3:E22, in the flashback to Sheldon and Leonard first signing the roommate aggreement, they agree to visit that moment in time should either of them invent time travel. However, in the opening of S1:E4 (later chronologically, but a previous episode), he ponders time travel, proclaiming that if he invents time travel, he would just give it back to himself. However, at this point, he would by his own logic, know he has not invented time travel.
