title: On changing thine legal name (UK)

## Preface
Here I record my preachings about the process of changing one's legal name, here in the United Kingdom. 
With personal anecdotes and ruminations, I hope this is not too verbose an overview of the general process.

Also note: I am not a lawyer. Don't take my advice as anything more than advice from someone on the internet.

## Context
Picking a name is another battle entirely I shall assume the reader has already fought. Do not assume its ommission is a signal of its insignificace.
On the contrary, its scope is larger than may be neatly sumarised here.

As a student at UCL, the only university to leave the stonewall program, I knew there would be some hurdles I would need to clear if I was to exist
with the name I wished. This blog post is borne of a discussion with other brave students, wishing to fight the same fight. I hope I may make the path clearer.

## Deed poll
The first step to changing one's name is to create a deed poll. 
Making this, then getting everyone to believe it (easier said than done), is in fact the entire legal process to using a new name.

### How to make a dead poll
The process is decribed by the goverment here: [https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll). It may seem too simple, but it is true.
One only needs to write that one has done so, with two witnessess, and you will have legally changed your name. This is in fact the easy bit. The difficulty comes later in getting everyone to believe you.

### Make it look official
To make it look more than a note on a piece of paper, make it a fancy note on a piece of paper. You don't need a "specialist agency or a solicitor" to do this; just a grandiose font and baroque language. Better yet, go to [https://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk/](https://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk/) and use their template. You'll get something like this:

### Multiple originals
I would recommend making multiple originals (also confusingly called "original copies") of your deed poll. Whilst some institutions are satisfied by photocopies or electronic scans, you may find multiple institutions want to see your original deed poll, and they wish to do so at the same time. Having multiple originals means you can satisfy them, without waiting for it to be given back before you send it off again.

To have multiple originals, simply print off several of the unsigned deed poll, and with your witnessess, sign them all in turn.

Doing this also means you are less likely to accidentally lose the original(s), and you may feel safe in not paying for special delivery. (Special delivery is a specific service Royal Mail offers, but in refering to this I also include tracked, signed for, 1st class etc. services.)

### Enrollment
One way to do this which  the goverment mentions, but I do not recommend, is to get your deed poll enrolled. This costs £42.44 and involves putting your deed poll on public record. However, this is a double-edged sword. Whilst this allows anyone to see that your new name is legally your new name, it also allows anyone at all, for all time, to look up your deadname. This, the cost, and the incovinience mean that I would not recommend this path.

## Changing your name in practice.
Now that you have changed your name legally, it is now your responsibility (nay, your legal obligation?), to change your name in practice. This involves thinking of every single person and organisation that knows your deadname, and telling them to change it to your new name. 

(Maybe I described this hyperbolicly. I don't mean to scare you; I don't believe the government arrests people for languishing in this endevour. I merely wish to impress upon you thaat no-one is obliged to help.)

For people, the task of getting them to use your new name is its own topic I will not cover here, except to say; since your deed poll is a legal document, you may use it to remind naysayers of the legal weight behind your new name.

Changing your name with organisations can be difficult for the ill-prepared. Many will want to see evidence of your new name in some combination of passport, drivers licence, bank statement, NHS letter, council letter, utility bill, payslip etc. I hope my advice shall help demystify this affair. 

Remember that many services, such as social media accounts, require no evidence. You may change these without delay.

### Driving licence
Changing your driving licence is the first step, since the only evidence you need is your deed poll. See [https://www.gov.uk/change-name-driving-licence](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-driving-licence). This is free, or if you want to update your photo at the same time, you can pay £17.

Likely your course of action will be to get a D1 form from a post office, then send the form, the original deed poll, and the old driving licence to the DVLA. 

If you want to change your photo, you may need to get this signed by someone else as being a true likeness of yourself. Getting your deed poll witness to sign this photo at the same time as doing the deed poll may expedite procceedings.

### Passport
Once you have your driving licence you may like to change your passport next. For this you need the deed poll and one other piece of evidence (driving licence). Unfortunately it does cost £75.50 online and more by paper application form.

Some would-be forms of evidence can quickly verify your identity by looking up your passport number, so by having a passport, you can change these rapidly.

### Other places to change
Electoral role, council, bank etc. evidence requirements ...
