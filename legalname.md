title: On changing thine legal name (UK)

## Preface
Here I record my preachings about the process of changing one's legal name, here in the United Kingdom. 
With personal anecdotes and ruminations, I hope this is not too verbose an overview of the general process.

## Context
Picking a name is another battle entirely I shall assume the reader has already fought. Do not assume its ommission is a signal of its insignificace.
On the contrary, its scope is larger than may be neatly sumarised here.

As a student at UCL, the only university to leave the stonewall program, I knew there would be some hurdles I would need to clear if I was to exist
with the name I wished. This blog post is borne of a discussion with other brave students, wishing to fight the same fight. I hope I may make the path clearer.

## Deed poll
The first step to changing one's name, is to create a deed poll. 
Making this, then getting everyone to belive it (easier said than done), is in-fact the entire legal process to using a new name.

The process is decribed by the goverment here: https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll.
