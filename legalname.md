title: On changing thine legal name (UK)

## Preface
Here I record my preachings about the process of changing one's legal name, here in the United Kingdom. 
With personal anecdotes and ruminations, I hope this is not too verbose an overview of the general process.

Also note: I am not a lawyer. Don't take my advice as anything more than advice from someone on the internet.

## Context
Picking a name is another battle entirely I shall assume the reader has already fought. Do not assume its ommission is a signal of its insignificace.
On the contrary, its scope is larger than may be neatly sumarised here.

As a student at UCL, the only university to leave the stonewall program, I knew there would be some hurdles I would need to clear if I was to exist
with the name I wished. This blog post is borne of a discussion with other brave students, wishing to fight the same fight. I hope I may make the path clearer.

## Deed poll
The first step to changing one's name is to create a deed poll. 
Making this, then getting everyone to belive it (easier said than done), is in fact the entire legal process to using a new name.

### How to make a dead poll
The process is decribed by the goverment here: https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll/make-an-adult-deed-poll. It may seem too simple, but it is true.
One only needs to write that one has done so, with two witnessess, and you will have legally changed your name. This is in fact the easy bit. The difficulty comes later in getting everyone to believe you.

### Make it look official
To make it look more than a note on a piece of paper, make it a fancy note on a piece of paper. You don't need a "specialist agency or a solicitor" to do this; just a grandiose font and baroque language. Better yet, go to https://www.freedeedpoll.org.uk/ and use their template. You'll get something like this:

### Multiple originals
I would recommend making multiple originals (also confusingly called "original copies") of your deed poll. Whilst some institutions are satisfied by photocopies or electronic scans, you may find multiple institutions want to see your original deed poll, and they wish to do so at the same time. Having multiple originals means you can satisfy them, without waiting for it to be given back before you send it off again.

To have multiple originals, simply print off several of the unsigned deed poll, and with your witnessess, sign them all in turn.

### Enrollment
One way to do this which  the goverment mentions, but I do not recommend, is to get your deed poll enrolled. This costs Â£42.44 and involves putting your deed poll on public record. However, this is a double-edged sword. Whilst this allows anyone to see that your new name is legally your new name, it also allows anyone at all, for all time, to look up your deadname. This, the cost, and the incovinience mean that I would not recommend this path.
